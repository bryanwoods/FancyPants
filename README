v0.1 = has_many_edges

Just a quick heads up, since you're here- I just opened up this project and haven't gotten to do a lot of testing so there are surely still bugs and issues. Most notably I haven't finished debugging IE, so: Not recommended for production!

Feel free to fork and contribute, or post bugs and issues.
