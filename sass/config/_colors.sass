/*

The easiest way to generate a new color scheme is to set a base color here.  
The color scheme is generated below based on relative values, and implemented 
throughout. You can obviously tweak that below, or go through and set your colors 
for each element by hand, but I've tried to set this up to give you a quick idea 
of how different colors might work for your content. Tends to work better when a 
rich color is used, as the scheme is created by adding and subtracting various 
amounts of gray to the base.

Some other fun base colors to try:
fancy blue - #034569
lime green - #4E9600
ruby red - #A60C00
bright pink - #CE0071
royal purple - #45036F
mustard plug - #A67000
