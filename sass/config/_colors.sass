/*

The easiest way to generate a new color scheme is to set a base color here, 
ussually something with a medium value.  The color scheme is generated
below based on relative values, and implemented throughout. You can obviously
tweak that below, or go through and set your colors for each element by hand,
but I've tried to set this up to give you a quick idea of how different
colors might work for your content. Many times the results are pretty nice.

Some other fun base colors to try:
fancy blue - #034569
lime green - #4E9600
ruby red - #A60C00
bright pink - #CE0071
royal purple - #45036F
mustard plug - #A67000

//color scheme

/*
Change these values or the way they are calculated to set colors
for the main content area, right now they are set to white, but
you could do something like "!base + #777" etc.
