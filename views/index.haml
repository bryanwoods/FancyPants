              v0.3 960gs and a generator
            %p
              Just a quick heads up, since you're here- this project is still very new and changing every day, so unless you're planning to contribute, I wouldn't put it into production just yet.
            %p
              Feel free to contribute, or

            %p
              I've been working to conform FancyPants to a 12 column 960 grid, based on Nathan Smith's 960gs.  As such, you can now view 12, 16, or 24 column grids under your layout by using the classes in config/_nineSixty.sass.

              FancyPants is a web app theme written in Sass, geared towards Ruby on Rails apps.
            %p
              FancyPants is probably best suited for:
            %ul
              %li
                %a{:href=>"http://rubyonrails.org/"}
                  Ruby on Rails

              FancyPants is new, un-tested, and a learning experience for me also, so use it at your own risk.

              What it's all about
            %p
              FancyPants is a new
              %span.italic
                theme
              with a few modest goals:
              %ul
                %li
                  Compatibility
                %li
                  Accessibility
                %li
                  Simplicity
                %li
                  Repeatability

              Why Sass?
            %p
              There are still those reluctant to pick up simple mark up languages like Haml and Sass, but that's just silly.  You could master both in a mere couple of hours, and the amount of time, keystrokes, and confused eyeballs they will save you is immeasurable.
            %p
              I strongly suggest you take a look at what these two languages have to offer, and consider giving up a few hours really getting them down.  Your fingers will thank you.
